# Data Anonymization

This book will walk through the code from Rida's internship project. Please access the presentation slides for more information on the project, as this site will only contain the Jupyter notebooks. Feel free to reach out to Rida at [ridan@bu.edu](mailto:ridan@bu.edu) for more information. 

Outline:

-   Intro to data anonymization and business problem
-   Simpler anonymization techniques: quick demos, pros/cons, use cases
-   More complex anonymization techniqe demos: k-anonymization, l-diversity, t-closeness, maybe differential privacy algorithms
-   Maybe: Evaluating success of anonymization techniques via ml models? Otherwise evaluate via visualizations
-   Overview of best practices and tools
